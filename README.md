(Exp : TarsosDSP Yin Implementation by Joren Six)

This is the project of music tuition system that is a tool that helps users to improve their skills to perform music.
This thesis aims at developing a computer based interactive tuition system specifically for Turkish music. The tuition
system will not be a comprehensive educational system but is limited to the implementation of a system that helps the
user to learn from a recording uploaded by the user. This involves implementation of pitch analysis and visualisation
tools that can work real-time and provide a visual feedback to the user for comparison of the user input signal and the
reference recording.


It's designed,implemented and developed by Bilge Mirac ATICI; supervised by Baris BOZKURT for M,Sc. thesis on Bahcesehir University,Turkey.
